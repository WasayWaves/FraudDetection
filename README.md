# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a machine learning model. The challenge lies in the enormous and imbalanced dataset, where the majority of transactions are non-fraudulent. This project aims to effectively identify fraudulent transactions to prevent customers from being charged for items they did not purchase.

## Features
- Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Employs SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle the imbalanced dataset issue.
- Analyzes and visualizes data to understand the characteristics of fraudulent and valid transactions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip

### Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
